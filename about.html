                        When given a brain teaser, she enjoys thinking outside the box and solving problems creatively and loves to learn new things, methods, and techniques to problems. When by herself, she enjoys spending her time online and following along with current trends, playing video games, and hanging out at cafes with friends and coworkers. When it comes to programs, she enjoys teaching herself new approaches to Adobe Creative Cloud to find an efficient way to do things quickly while maintaining quality. She continues to strive for quality with a pinch of fun while expanding outside of her comfort zone.
