                        Rose is currently enrolled in her graduating year at St. Clair College in the Graphic Design Program. She is dedicated to her work and isn't afraid to improve on what she knows. Her education at the college has prepared her for the Graphic Design industry, covering a wide variety of a graphic designer's job including photography, copywriting, and coding. She has learned to be thorough with her work by drawing thumbnails and getting feedback from others to create a product of the highest quality. Rose has also gained knowledge and experience by working under David Jacob Duke at Creative Design Studio as a Junior Graphic Designer.

                        When given a brain teaser, she enjoys thinking outside the box and solving problems creatively and loves to learn new things, methods, and techniques to problems. When by herself, she enjoys spending her time online and following along with current trends, playing video games, and hanging out at cafes with friends and coworkers. When it comes to programs, she enjoys teaching herself new approaches to Adobe Creative Cloud to find an efficient way to do things quickly while maintaining quality.
